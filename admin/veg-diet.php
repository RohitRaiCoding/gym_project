            cultivating it in South America since ancient times (1Trusted Source).In fact, hundreds of years ago, the Inca people considered
             this ancient grain a sacred food.<br>

               Beets pull toxins from the body and are an excellent source of many nutrients like folate, vitamin a, k, manganese, copper, and potassium, among others.
                They are high in nitrates which help regulate blood flow and may assist patients with cardiovascular diseases. Beets also have pigments called betalain,
             responsible for their vibrant color, which provide anti-inflammatory benefits.
